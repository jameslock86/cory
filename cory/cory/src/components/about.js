        <p className="about-text"> My name is Cory Jones - and I like to do one thing…. Play that loud ass funky shit, 
            boi. Bordello is another word for a brothel and so the first time I heard that word 
            in a band name my immediate next thought was PunkBordello (Punk Rock Whorehouse). I 
            came up with it a very, long time ago and quite honestly it just sounded like the most 
            Punk shit I’d ever heard. So I kept it and now I’m running with it. 
	          Now My first album, “Epitaph” was me realizing what I had the potential to do with basic
             tools and a dream. I spent an incredible amount of time creating and just learning how 
             to produce everything on that album with a small amount of help. 
	          This next album (entitled eponymously) “PunkBordello” is going to be a reflection of 
            everything |I’ve learned in the time since. An acknowledgement that punk is purely an 
            attitude, yet the most punk shit I could ever do is whatever experimental thing I can 
            think of for the song. 
	          I believe in music without limitations - “For the love of music”. 
            Growth without limitations allowed us to be the versions of ourselves we actually should strive to be.
